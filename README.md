Execution is very simple. Just go to the folder of classes for whatever the version you want to run and run the '.class' file of the tictactoe. For example, I want to use version 2, I will go to the classes folder of version 2 and run the 'tictactoe2.class' file with standard JVM. The version 2 is the main version.
